# Displaying a database table: the row-list buffer

A **row-list buffer** shows some metainformation on the table and its columns, then the row data in
tabular form, as illustrated below.

![Screenshot table](img/screenshot-table.png)

If the table contains a large number of rows, the contents will be **paginated**, with `Next` and
`Previous` buttons to move page by page. The number of rows in each page is determined by the
variable `pgmacs-row-limit`.

A column which is a part of a primary key will be displayed using the customizable
`pgmacs-column-primary-key` face, which defaults to a bold version of the `pgmacs-table-data` face.
A column which references a foreign key will be displayed using the `pgmacs-column-foreign-key`
face, which defaults to a blue color.

The following keys are bound when the point is located in the row-list table:

| Key                             | Binding                                                                              |

These keybindings can be customized by modifying the `pgmacs-row-list-map` keymap, which contains
keybindings that apply everywhere in the row-list buffer, or by modifying the
`pgmacs-row-list-map/table` child keymap, which contains keybindings that are only relevant when
point is in the tabular data display (for example, commands that operate on a specific cell value).


Any functions on `pgmacs-row-list-hook` are run when a row-list buffer is opened. They are run just
before control is returned to the user, in a buffer with all data inserted. For example, if you
would like all column widths to be adjusted to the narrowest size possible given the data displayed
in the table (obtaining the same result as if you pressed <kbd>=</kbd> each time you open a row-list
buffer), you can include the following in your Emacs initialization file:

```lisp
(eval-after-load 'pgmacs
   (add-hook 'pgmacs-row-list-hook #'pgmacs--shrink-columns))
```



## Run a shell command or an external application on cell value

There are two methods for running an external (non-Emacs) command on the current cell value:

- Run a Unix filter shell command with the cell value as input: press <kbd>!</kbd>. This works
  similarly to the standard Emacs `shell-command` command, which is bound to
  <kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>!</kbd>. If called with a prefix argument, it will update the database value to
  the result of the shell command.

- Run a program asynchronously with the cell value as its first commandline argument: press
  <kbd>&amp;</kbd>. This works similarly to the standard Emacs `async-shell-command`, which is bound
  to <kbd>M</kbd>-<kbd>&amp;</kbd>.

For example, to count the number of characters in the current cell, type

    ! wc -c

To downcase the value of a text cell (and modify the value in the database) use

    C-u ! tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower]'

To reverse the order of the characters in the cell (and modify the value in
the database), use

    C-u ! rev

On a Microsoft Windows machine, you may need to install the [MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/)
commandline tools for these examples to work.

If the current cell contains a file name, you can launch your system’s default application for that
filename extension by typing <kbd>&amp;</kbd> then entering `xdg-open` (or `open` on a MacOS
machine).



## Follow foreign key references

A column that references data in a foreign table (`FOREIGN KEY`) will be shown in blue. If you type
<kbd>RET</kbd> when point is located on a foreign key reference, PGmacs will jump to the referenced
row and column in the other table. A new row-list buffer is opened; type <kbd>q</kbd> to come back
to the original row-list buffer.

## Filtering rows displayed using a WHERE expression

You may wish only to display the rows in a table that match an SQL `WHERE` filter. If you press
<kbd>W</kbd> in a row-list buffer, PGmacs will prompt you for a WHERE expression to use as a filter.
In the example illustrated by the video below, table `temperatures` includes a column
`measurement`. If you type a WHERE filter of `measurement < -5`, PGmacs will display rows
corresponding to the following SQL query:

```sql
SELECT * FROM temperatures WHERE measurement < -5
```

You can type <kbd>W</kbd> again to enter a new filter. To cancel the filter, type <kbd>W</kbd> and enter an
empty string (enter <kbd>W</kbd> <kbd>RET</kbd>).

The screen recording below illustrates the use of a WHERE filter on a large table that contains
various attributes concerning French inhabited locations. It starts by using a WHERE filter to
display only the row corresponding to the city of Toulouse based on its zip code, copies that row as
JSON with <kbd>j</kbd>, then with the copied latitude and longitude prepares a PostGIS query to
select (with an updated WHERE filter) rows that are within a certain geographic distance of
Toulouse, using the PostGIS function `ST_DistanceSphere`.

## Dired-like multi-row delete

You can “mark” rows for later deletion by pressing <kbd>d</kbd>. Each row marked for deletion will
be highlighted in a red color. You can then delete the marked rows by pressing <kbd>x</kbd> (for
“expunge”, as in `dired-mode`). To unmark a row, press <kbd>u</kbd>.


The screen capture below illustrates this functionality in
operation, combined with the WHERE filtering described above.

## Custom buttons in a row-list buffer

The list of buttons displayed above the rows of a table (“count rows”, “export to CSV” and so on)
is user-customizable via the variable `pgmacs-row-list-buttons`. To add a new button to this list,
add code such as the following to your Emacs initialization file:

```lisp
(require 'pgmacs)

(add-to-list 'pgmacs-row-list-buttons
   (pgmacs-shortcut-button
     :label "The displayed label"
     :action #'my/function-of-zero-arguments
     :help-echo "Help text echoed to minibuffer"))
```

If you prefer the button to be added to the end of the list, add a last argument of `t` to the
`add-to-list` invocation.
